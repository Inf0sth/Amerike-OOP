## An example whit instructions of how this project works.

We can init the game using: `$ java game` or `$ java /path_game_class/game`

The first turn is white.
We only need to enter the letter and then the number of our piece to move later.

Then we enter the destiny position coordinates (letter and number)

And the program will return us the new board:

Finally, we have to say to the program if we make a checkmate, to decide if the game continues or not:
